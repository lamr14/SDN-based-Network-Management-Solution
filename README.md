# SDN-based-Network-Management-Solution
In this project, we have developed a Network management application to monitor &amp; control an enterprise network comprising of OpenFlow Enabled switches and SNMP enabled devices. We are running this application on utilizing the REST interface spunned by the controller centralized Software Defined Networking controller. The SDN Controller we are using is an open-source controller named OpenDaylight(ODL). We have used the SNMP and OpenFlow Southbound Plugins to communicate to the networking devices. For testing the application, we have simulated a network in GNS3 with a combination of legacy devices and OpenFlow switches.
